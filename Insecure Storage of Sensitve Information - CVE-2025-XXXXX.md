### Affected entity: 
- Furbo 360
- Furbo Mini
#### Impact:
An attacker who obtains a previously owned device, such as one which has been returned to Amazon or another seller, may connect to the device over UART and retrieve the SSID and Wi-Fi password of the previous owner. Factory resets do not remove the contents of the /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf file used for Wi-Fi authentication. Using a website like Wigle.net they may be able to geo-locate the previous owner and travel to their home address where they could connect to their network. 

#### Replication Steps:
Connect to the device over UART. 
Run: 
`cat /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf`
Observe the WiFi SSID and password stored in clear text.
Evidence:
```
/tmp # cat wpa_supplicant.conf 
ctrl_interface=/tmp/wifi_socket
update_config=1

country=JP

network={
        ssid="B[REDACTED]7"
        scan_ssid=1
        psk="FF[REDACTED]96"
```
