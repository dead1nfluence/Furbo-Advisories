#### Affected Entity 
- Furbo 360
- Furbo Mini

#### Impact:
An attacker who obtains a previously owned device, such as one which has been returned to Amazon or another seller, may connect to the device over UART and retrieve the SSID and Wi-Fi password of the previous owner. Factory resets do not remove the contents of the /mnt/flash/config.json file used for Wi-Fi authentication. Using a website like Wigle.net they may be able to geo-locate the previous owner and travel to their home address where they could connect to their network. 

#### Replication Steps:
Connect to the device over UART. 
Run: 
`cat /mnt/flash/config.json`
Observe the WiFi SSID and password stored in clear text.
Evidence:
```
  "network/resource/ntp/1/port": 123,
  "network/resource/wifi/ssid": "42[REDACTED]37",
  "network/resource/wifi/password": "46[REDACTED]36",
  "network/resource/wifi/encMode": "wpa2psk",
```
